# tempidity-logger

Python 3 code for displaying and logging temperature/humidity data with a Raspberry Pi.

For this project I am using a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ with a DHT22 digital temperature and
humidity sensor connected to the RPi GPIO port.

I started the project by following the guide located at:
https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-humidity-sensor-dht22, which got me up and running but I 
decided to modify the code to improve the logging and display formats.

The main goal of this project is to begin learning how to program using Python and to develop
the software needed to to build a Raspberry Pi based outdoor weather station.

Another goal of this project is to learn how to use GitHub for this and future projects.

The current version of the Python code is in the /src directory.
