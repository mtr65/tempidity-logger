# tempidity-logger

Python 3 code for displaying and logging temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor. 

DESCRIPTION: A Python3 program to interface a DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor module with a
             Raspberry Pi via GPIO pins in order to log sensor data to a CSV logfile
             and display the readings in a terminal window.

For this project I am using a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ with a DHT22 digital 
temperature/humidity sensor module connected to the RPi GPIO pin 4.

I started the project by following the guide located at:

https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-humidity-sensor-dht22

This got me up and running but I decided to modify the code to change file logging and
display formatting while adding a conversion to Fahrenheit for display.

The main goal of this project is for me to start learning how to program with Python 3 and to develop
the software needed to build various Raspberry Pi based projects like a weather station.

A secondary goal of this project is to learn how to use GitHub for version control.
