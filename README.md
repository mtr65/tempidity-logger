# tempidity-logger

Python 3 code for displaying and logging temperature and humidity data with a Raspberry Pi.

For this project I am using a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ with a DHT22 digital 
temperature/humidity sensor module connected to the RPi GPIO port 16.

I started the project by following the guide located at:

https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-humidity-sensor-dht22

This got me up and running but I decided to modify the code to tweak the file logging and display formatting.

The main goal of this project is to start learning how to program using Python 3 and to develop
the software needed to to build a Raspberry Pi outdoor weather station.

Another goal of this project is to learn how to use GitHub for version control.

The current version of this program (v6.2) is in the /src directory.
